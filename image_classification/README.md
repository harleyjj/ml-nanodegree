# Image Classification

* Deep Learning neural network used to classify the images in the CIFAR-10 dataset, using two convolution layers and two fully-connected layers.
* Implemented neural network using TensorFlow, and computations carried out on Google Cloud virtual machine, run on Debian/Linux 
* Model achieved 67% accuracy using only 4 layers, 3x3 filters on convolution layers, 2x2 max-pooling, and 75% dropout on first fully-connected layer
