*	Clustering model for dividing a wholesaler’s customers into distinct segments based on buying patterns
*	Used NumPy and Scikit-Learn to carry out Principal Component Analysis on features, and then divide customers into two clusters using Gaussian Mixture Modeling
*	Feature transform and clustering predicted a binary classification variable that hadn’t been included with original data
